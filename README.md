# Pathfinding Visualizer

Pathing- visualizer is a visualizing web-app visualises how different path-finding algorithms in action. This is inspired by Clement's Pathfinding Visualizer (https://clementmihailescu.github.io/Pathfinding-Visualizer/). This has a 2D grid where movements from a node to another have a "cost" of 1. You can draw walls by clicking and hovering the mouse over the cells. When the selected algorithm finds the target node, the path will be illuminated in golden yellow.

(Note: Every algorithm doesnâ€™t guarantee the shortest path.)


## Meet the Algorithms

This application supports the following algorithms: 

**Dijkstra's Algorithm** (weighted): It guarantees the shortest path

**Bellman-Ford Algorithm*** (weighted): Faster and guarantee the shortest path

**Breath-first Search** (unweighted): It guarantees the shortest path

**Depth-first Search** (unweighted): It does not guarantee the shortest path
